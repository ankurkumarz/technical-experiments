# Low-code Platforms (LCAP)

## Gartner Definition of Low-code
- A low-code application platform (LCAP) is used to rapidly develop and deploy custom applications by abstracting and minimizing hand coding. At a minimum, an LCAP must include low-code capabilities (such as a model-driven or graphical programming approach with scripting) to develop a complete application consisting of user interfaces, business logic, workflow and data services.
- Low-code is the evolution of RAD to cloud and SaaS models. Note that Gartner defines a no-code application platform as an LCAP that only requires text entry for formulae or simple expressions. The LCAP market, therefore, includes no-code platforms.
